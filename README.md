^^ I used code from this thread to access the last record in the database.



ðŸŽ¯ What requirements did you achieve?
I achieved all requirements for this task, and also added the option for the user to sort posts by A-Z, Z-A, Most recent and default. 
I also exclusively used tailwind to code this project which was a good way for me to get used to it.

ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
I would have liked to make it so that when posts are deleted the page would refresh and redirect, but I didn't get around to this.
